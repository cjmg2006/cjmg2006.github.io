            <p> Many of us tend to purchase goods without understanding the full context behind our purchases, and we unwittingly become slaves to passive consumerism. One of these everyday 'luxury' goods of our 21st century is coffee, and could we perhaps create any understanding around the coffee we purchase daily?  </p>

            <p> Augmented reality (AR) is an emerging medium that is promising for this end - it is very good at presenting information in context, but how could we also use it as a storytelling tool? Could we take full advantage of the affordances of augmented reality to create a powerful experience that encourages people to understand their purchases better? </p>

                <ul> <b> 2-minute Rule </b> <br> We determined the time between placing an order and getting it was the ideal time for our AR intervention. Customers tended to wait for ~2 min, and thus our AR experience should not exceed that. </ul>
                <ul> <b> People were curious about their coffee </b> <br> 66% of our survey respondents did not know about how their coffee was produced, and 45% were interested to find out. </ul>
                <ul> <b> People wanted to learn about social and environmental impact of their coffee. </b> <br> The 3 most important factors that emerged from our survey were: price breakdown of their coffee, human/labor rights issues surrounding it, and the environmental sustainability. </ul>

        <p> We demonstrated the proof-of-concept application at a showcase open to the Stanford HCI community and their families. To our delight, users of all ages, including 12-year-olds and 50-year-olds, found the 2 main interactions we created entertaining and informative. </p>

        <p> Given another cycle of iteration, we would find and design more 'easter egg' microinteractions, since each user's interaction should be as short and impactful as possible. </p>
